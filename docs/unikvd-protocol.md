# UniKVd Protocol

UniKVd is a simple daemon for unikv.

Based on HTTP, the protocol is simpler than simple.

## Describe

Path to the data is described in URI in the following format:

```uri
/v1/NAMESPACE/BUCKET/KEY
```

When you need to access `count` under `web` bucket under `public` namespace, you need to:

```uri
http://server-ip:port/v1/public/web/count
```

When you GET this address, you will get the result in json.

When you POST this address, the body will be the data.

When you DELETE this address, the key will be deleted.

## System Namespace

When you get `/v1/_system/*`, you are visiting system namespace.
